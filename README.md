# Rock, Paper, Scissors

This is a simple JavaScript game of rock, paper, scissors. This is courtesy of a tutorial from a freecodecamp.org video showing how to create seven games using JavaScript: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-javascript-by-coding-7-games/. I highly recommend this video if you haven't seen it!

The basic JavaScript and HTML code was provided in the video. All that is added here is some simple styling and a scoreboard.
